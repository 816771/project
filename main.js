This puppy is a transcript that was painstakingly transcribed using the screenplay and/or viewings of the movie to get the dialogue. I know, I know, I still need to get the cast names in there and all that jazz, so if you have any corrections, feel free to drop me a line. At least you\u0027ll have some Bee Movie quotes (or even a monologue or two) to annoy your coworkers with in the meantime, right?\nAnd swing on back to Drew\u0027s Script-O-Rama afterwards -- because reading is good for your noodle.
